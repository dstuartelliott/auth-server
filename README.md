# auth-server

A basic standalone auth server ready to go!
I mostly created this repo to be able to quickly reuse it in the future, but feel free to use it for your needs!

## Setup:

```
yarn install
```

You will need to add 3 secret keys to a .env file. I included an example.env, but make sure to rename it to .env and never commit it to your repo!!

1- `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`

2- `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET`

These 2 are random strings that will be used for a base to sign your tokens.

They can be generated with node's crypto library, like so:

```
require("crypto").randomBytes(64).toString("hex")
```

Run this line in a node terminal twice, to get 2 completely different random strings similar to this one:

`47b24e8ad547d0b9533372a263cba477e00a6083b2b75fbcd513af8f1eed428ee585b5a16a3fc3883a4f7360a2f9b34424a3cce6d65fa6bd2181fb542e58c6a4`

3- `MONGO_URI`

This is your MongoDB credentials, also needs to be kept secret.
Setting up your database is a whole other tutorial, but this is were we are retrieving your user credentials (username, password) for authentication, and keeping the refresh tokens safe.

## Your authentication server is index.js.

It contains 4 routes:

#### POST

```
/createUser
```

This route accepts the credentials from the front-end (name, password), only if an existing user wasn't already in the db with this username.

It encrypts the password, generates an access token and a refresh token, and then calls the addUser function from the `userDb.js` helpers to add the user to the database if everything went well.

It returns both tokens back to the client.

#### POST

```
/login
```

This route validates the client's username and password, and if it matches, it creates a `token`, a `refreshToken`, which is added to the database
Then, it sends both tokens back to the client.

#### POST

```
/token
```

This route is used when the client's token is expired. The client uses the `refreshToken` in the body of the request to this route to recieve a new `access token` that will be valid for the duration specified in `constants.js`.

#### DELETE

```
/logout
```

This route is used when the user wants to log out on their client. This uses their refresh tokens and deletes it from the database, ensuring that no new access tokens can be created from this `refreshToken`. They will have to login again to receive a new pair of token and `refreshToken`.

## Server Config: `constants.js`

`Constants.js` contains variables that are used by the helper functions.

`DATABASE_NAME`

`TOKENS_COLLECTION`

`USERS_COLLECTION`

Enter your database and collection names for your users and tokens.

`TOKEN_DURATION`

Use a duration that suits your needs.

## Server helper functions

The functions are in `/helpers/serverHelpers.js`

Make sure your login function correctly plucks the identifier out of your user from your database, to call sign it in a `token`. It could be anything you set up in your `createUser` function.

## Example API Server

`apiServer.js` is purely added as an example, and contains the very important "authenticateToken" function.

This function should be located on your api server and needs to use the same `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` as your auth server.

**This is critical, otherwise the signature on the tokens won't match!**
